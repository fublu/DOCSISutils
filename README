I work a lot with DOCSIS cable modems. You often need to get
cable modem SW version, restart it, force SW upgrade.
Those tools allows mi to make this task via command line.
I had version written in python but C version is easier and faster on 
small old computers I usually use like ARM based IomegaConnect 
changed to small server :)
I'm not a "C" expert and code is dirty. This stuff was made for me and it works for me.
